# About Me

> I am a dotnet developer and love to explore new technologies. When time permits, I experiment with new software stacks.

These days I am exploring

* Serverless functions (FAAS)
* Traefik
* Self-hosting on my old laptop (which may still have some juice left in it) using:

    * [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/)
    * [Traefik](https://traefik.io/)
    * Docker

This site is essentially a documentation of my development explorations.
