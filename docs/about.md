# About Me

> I am a dotnet developer, an avid gamer (jeez what a surprise) and love to explore new technologies. I am a new father and when I have juggled my priorities :stuck_out_tongue:, I experiment with new software stacks.    
> As technologies change daily, I believe on-the-job experience should be augmented with off hour developmental explorations. I am hoping by working on this site I would be taking a small step in this direction.

These days I am exploring

* Serverless functions (FAAS)
  * Prototyping with OpenFaaS
  * Implementing AWS Lambda functions with [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/)
* Traefik - venturing into reverse-proxies.
* Self-hosting on my old laptop (which may still have some juice left in it) using:

    * [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/)
    * [Traefik](https://traefik.io/)
    * Docker

This site is essentially a documentation of my development explorations.
